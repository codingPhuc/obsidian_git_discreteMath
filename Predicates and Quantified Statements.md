definition (Predicate)
- a predicate is a sentence that contain a finite number of varibles and only becomes a statement when those varibles are fill in with  when specific values are subsituted for the variables 
- the domain of a prdicate varible is the set of all values that may be subtituted in place of the varible 
definition (truth set )
- if P(x) is a predicate and x has domain D , the truth set is the set of all elements of D that make P(x) true when thay are substituted for x . 
- the truth set of P(x) is denoted {x $\in$ D | P(x)}

ex: 
Q(n ) be the predicate "n is a factor of 8"
a. the domain of n is the set Z+ of all positive integers
	{1,2,4,8} bedcause these are exactly the positive integers that divide 8 evenly 
b. the domain of n is the set Z of all integers 
	{-8,-4,-2,-1, 1,2,4,8} because these are exactly the  integers that divide 8 evenly
