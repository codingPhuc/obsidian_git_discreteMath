# what is a modulo 
the result of a the remainder after subtraction 
example 
5 mod 3 = 2 
6 mod 3 =0 
7.1 mod 3 =1.1 
# the Euclidean algorithm 
let say that we want to find an inverse 27^-1(mod 392)
we have this formula : 
	392= [27] * (14) + [(392- 27 * 14 )]
	with 14 being the number of time 392 divide 27 ie : 392/27 
	then we move each number to the right braket number to left
	27 = 14 * 1 + 13 
	and so on 
	14= 13 * 1 +1
## RSA encrytion algorithms 
encryption : (5,14) 
we need this pair of number it is a lock 
exp : send "B"tranform it into number 2 
2^5 (mod 14) = 32(mod 14)
					= 4 (mod 14) get the remainder of the number 32
ciphertext : D 
decryption:(11,14)
4^11 (mod 14)= 4194304(mod 14)
					=
