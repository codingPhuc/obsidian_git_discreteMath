# what is a modulo 
the result of a the remainder after subtraction 
example 
5 mod 3 = 2 
6 mod 3 =0 
7.1 mod 3 =1.1 
# the Euclidean algorithm 
let say that we want to find an inverse 27^-1(mod 392)
we have this formula : 
	392= [27] * (14) + [(392- 27 * 14 )]
	with 14 being the number of time 392 divide 27 ie : 392/27 
	then we move each number to the right braket nu
