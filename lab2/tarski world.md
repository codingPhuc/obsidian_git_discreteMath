$\forall$t , triangle(t) -> Bule(t)
if a shape is a triangle , then the shape is bule 
$\exists$ , Bule(x)  $\land$  ~triangle(x) 
there exists a shape that is bule and not a triangle 


baese on the tarski world , determine the validitu of : 
1. for all trianbles x , there is a spare y such that x  and y have the same color . true 
2. there is a t
