$\forall$t , triangle(t) -> Bule(t)
if a shape is a triangle , then the shape is bule 
$\exists$ , Bule(x)  $\land$  ~triangle(x) 
there exists a shape that is bule and not a triangle 


baese on the tarski world , determine the validitu of : 
1. for all trianbles x , there is a spare y such that x  and y have the same color . true 
$\forall$x , $\exists$y  triangle(x)$\land$spare(y)$\land$samecolor(s,y)
3. there is a triangle x such that for all circles y , x is to the right of y 

4.  for all circle x , x is above 
5. for all circles x  , there is a spuare y such that x and y have the same color .
