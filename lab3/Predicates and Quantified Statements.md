definition (Predicate)
- a predicate is a sentence that contain a finite number of varibles and only becomes a statement when those varibles are fill in with  when specific values are subsituted for the variables 
- the domain of a prdicate varible is the set of all values that may be subtituted in place of the varible 
definition (truth set )
- if P(x) is a predicate and x has domain D , the truth set is the set of all elements of D that make P(x) true when thay are substituted for x . 
- the truth set of P(x) is denoted {x $\in$ D | P(x)}

ex: 
Q(n ) be the predicate "n is a factor of 8"
a. the domain of n is the set Z+ of all positive integers
	{1,2,4,8} bedcause these are exactly the positive integers that divide 8 evenly 
b. the domain of n is the set Z of all integers 
	{-8,-4,-2,-1, 1,2,4,8} because these are exactly the  integers that divide 8 evenly 
## Quantifiers 
#sumarize 
Quantifiers are words that refer to quantities such as "some " or " all"and tell for how many elements a given predicate is true 
the symbol $\forall$ denotes "for all" is call a universal quantifier 
## definition 
let Let Q(x) be a predicate and D the domain of x. A universal  
statement is a statement of the form  "$\forall$ $\in$ D, Q(x)".
- it is defined to be true iff Q(x) is true for every x in D 
- it is defined to be false iff Q(x) is false for at least one x in D 
A value for x for which Q(x) is false is called a counterexample 

the symbol $\exists$ is the existential quantifier : 
example : "there is a student in CS1231" can be written as 
$\exists$ a person p such that p is a student in CS1231 
or , more formally 
$\exists$ $\in$ P such that p is a student in CS1231 
where P is the set of all people 
the word such that are inserted just before the predicate 
## definition 
LetQ(x) be a predicate and D the domain of x. An existential  
statement is a statement of the form "$\exists$x $\in$ D such that Q(x)"
- it is defined to be true iff Q(x) is true for at least one x in D . 
- it is defined to be flase iff Q(x) is false for all x in D
