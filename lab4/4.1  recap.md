if n and d are integers and d  != 0 then 
	n is dicisible by d if   ,and only if , n ewuals d times some integer 
Instead of " n is divisible by d" we can say that 
	n is multiple of d , or 
	d is factor of n , or 
	d is a divisor of n , or , 
	d divides n 
the notation d| n is read "d divides n" Symbolically , if n and d are integers and d != 0 : 
	d|n  $\exists$ and integer k suck that n = dk.
