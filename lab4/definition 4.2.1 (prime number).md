An integer n is prime number if ,and only if , n> 1 and for positive integers r and s , if n= rs , then either r or s equals m . An integer n is composite if , and only if , n > 1 and n=rs for some integers r and s with 1 < r <n  and 1 < s < n 
in dymbols : 
n is prime  <-> $\forall$ positive integers r and s , if n = rs 
						 then either r = 1 and s =n or r =n and s =1v
n is composite <-> $\exists$ positive integers r and s such that n = rs 
							and 1<r <n and 1 < s < n. 

- 1 is neither prime nor composite 
- the first few primes are 2,3,5,7
