#sumarize 
	the set of primes is infinite 
proof 
1. supppose the set of promes is finite : a total of k primes 
2. the we may list all the primes : p1,p2,p3 , .... , p5 

## theorem 4.2.3 
if p is a prime and x1,x2 , ......,xn are any integers such that : 
	p|x1x2......xn 
then p |xi , for some xi (1 =< i =< n )
