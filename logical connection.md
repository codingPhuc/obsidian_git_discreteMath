   Negation: $\neg P$, read as "not P"
### Conjunction: 
 - $P \land Q$, read as "P and Q"
 - if p and q are statement variables , the conjunction of p and q is "p and q", denoted p $\land$ q 
###  Disjunction:
- $P \lor Q$, read as "P or Q"
- if p and q are statement variables , the disjunction of p and q is " p or q", denoted p $\lor$ q 

-   Implication: $P \rightarrow Q$, read as "if P then Q"
-   Biconditional: $P \leftrightarrow Q$, read as "P if and only if Q"
