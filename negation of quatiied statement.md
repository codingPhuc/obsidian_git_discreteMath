## Negation of a Universal Statement 
symbolically 
	($\forall$x in D, P(x)) $\equiv$ $\forall$x in D such that ~P(x) 

that is , the negation of an existential statement ("some are") is logicallly equivalent to a universial statement ("some are not or "there is at least  ont that is not")

## negation of an existential statement 

~($\exists$x in D such that P(x))$\equiv$ $\forall$x in D , ~P(x) 
That is, the negation of an existential statement (“some  
are”) is logically equivalent to a universal statement  
(“none are” or “all are not”)
#example
$\forall$ primes p , p is odd 
- $\exists$ prime $p$ such that $p$ is not odd.
$\exists$ a triangle T such that the sum of the angles of T equals 200$\circ$ 
- $\forall$ triangle $T$, the sum of the angles of $T$ $\neq$ 200$\circ$.

* ~(p$\land$ q) $\equiv$ ~p $\lor$ ~q 
* ~(p $\lor$ q) $\equiv$ ~p $\land$ ~q 
* ~(p-> q) $equi
