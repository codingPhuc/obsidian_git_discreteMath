## aditional point 
repeated elemetn are listed once 
{a,b,a,c,b,a} = {a,b,c}
there is no order in a set 
{3,2,1} = {1,2,3}
		 = {2,1,3}
## common sets 
### natural number 
N = {0,1,2,3,...} or {1,2,3,...}
### integers 
Z = {-inf ,..,0,1,...,+inf}
### Rational number 
Q ={any number you can write as a faction}
## elements and cardinality
